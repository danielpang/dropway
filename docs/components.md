# Dropway components & architecture (self-host)

How the runtime pieces fit together in a **self-hosted** Dropway: what each service
is responsible for, its main use cases, and which other services it calls. This is
the plain-Go / Docker-Compose topology (`deploy/docker-compose.yml`) — `serve` + Caddy
at the content edge, Redis/Valkey for the route projection, and MinIO for object
storage. (The hosted SaaS swaps these for the Cloudflare serving Worker, Workers KV,
and R2 respectively; component responsibilities are identical.)

Diagrams below are the pre-rendered PNGs in `docs/diagrams/`; the `.mmd` files there
are the source of truth.

## System diagram

The runtime components are identical across topologies; only the infrastructure
differs. The self-host diagram is below; the hosted-SaaS variant (Cloudflare Worker
+ Workers KV + R2, Supabase Postgres, and the `cloud/` Stripe billing module) is in
[`docs/diagrams/`](./diagrams/README.md#1-components--directional-requests).

## Components

### dashboard — `apps/dashboard` (Next.js)
The control-plane UI and the **identity authority**.

**Main use cases**
- Web UI to manage organizations, sites, deploys, members, domains, the org's shared **skills** (author in a Markdown editor or drag-and-drop upload, edit a skill into a new version, search by folder/preset, download as zip, admin folder curation), and shared **chat logs** (browse the org library, view a transcript, toggle a site's "How this was made" panel). Sites and skills also surface in the cross-user **feed** (vote, comment, share/unshare).
- **Authentication** via Better Auth: email/password, magic link, and (optional) Google SSO.
- The **OAuth 2.1 authorization server** for the CLI (`dropway login`) and MCP clients — DCR, authorize, consent (`/oauth/consent`), token.
- The **`/authz` edge-token exchange**: a gated-content viewer with a dashboard session is redirected here, and the dashboard asks the API to mint a host-scoped edge token.
- Owns + migrates the **`identity` schema** (user/session/account/verification/jwks/organization/member/invitation).
- Mints short-lived **EdDSA JWTs** (org_id claim) and publishes the **JWKS** the API + MCP verify against.

**Calls**
- **Postgres** — `identity` schema, over a privileged/owner connection (it CREATEs its own tables). Self-host wires this via `BETTER_AUTH_DATABASE_URL`.
- **api** — every business action, as a Bearer EdDSA JWT (the dashboard never touches the `app` schema directly).
- **SMTP** (e.g. Mailpit locally) — verification, magic-link, and password-reset mail; no-ops to logs when `MAIL_SMTP_URL` is unset, so a no-email self-host still works.

**Called by** users (session cookie); the CLI + LLM agents (OAuth); the api + mcp (fetch JWKS to verify tokens).

---

### api — `services/api` (Go)
The **system of record and the authorization boundary**. Every mutation goes through here.

**Main use cases**
- Owns + migrates the **`app` schema** (sites, versions, domains, allowlist, skills, skill_versions, skill_folders, skill_folder_items, chat_logs, chat_messages, post_votes, post_comments, org_meta, org_usage, audit_log) — accessed as the non-superuser, non-BYPASSRLS **`dropway_app`** role with per-request RLS tenant context.
- **Verifies every JWT** against the dashboard JWKS (pins EdDSA + iss + aud).
- The **deploy pipeline**: `prepare` (manifest → missing blobs + presigned PUT URLs) → client uploads → `finalize` (write manifest, insert version) → `publish` (flip `current_version_id`, write the route projection).
- **Org-wide skill sharing** (`/v1/skills`, `/v1/skill-folders`): the same prepare → presign → finalize upload contract (finalize publishes — skills are latest-only, each version carrying a monotonic number surfaced as the skill's `version` for update detection), admin-curated folders with preset flags, bulk folder download, and lazy per-org seeding of the default folders + starter presets (guarded by `org_meta.skills_seeded`).
- **Org feed** (`/v1/feed`): a unified newest-first list of shared sites **and** skills, each tagged by `kind`, with polymorphic votes + comments (`app.post_votes`/`app.post_comments` over a `subject_type` of `'site'`/`'skill'`) and per-post feed-visibility.
- **Chat-log sharing** (`/v1/chats`): publish an agent session transcript (Claude Code JSONL, ChatGPT export, or plain text, normalized server-side) as a chat log, standalone in the org library or attached to a site. Attaching compiles the transcript to a JSON object in the object store and stamps `chat_id` (route projection v4) onto the site's routes, so the edge injects a "How this was made" panel served under the site's own access mode. `append_chat` adds conversation turns and action annotations as work continues.
- **Mints host-scoped edge tokens** (`/v1/authz/mint`) for gated viewers, after checking membership/allowlist + revocation. Signs them with `EDGE_SIGNING_KEY` (stable Ed25519 seed) and publishes the edge JWKS at `/.well-known/edge-jwks`.
- Writes the **route projection** (`route:<host>`) and **revocation denylist** to the edge store.
- **ensure-org-provisioned**: lazily creates `app.org_meta` + `org_usage` for a tenant on first authenticated call.

**Calls**
- **Postgres** — `app` schema as `dropway_app` (RLS), via `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Object store** (MinIO) — presign uploads (`S3_*`), write deploy manifests.
- **Edge store** (Redis/Valkey) — write route projection + revocation.
- **dashboard JWKS** — verify incoming JWTs.

**Called by** dashboard, CLI, mcp (the write bridge), and `serve` (edge JWKS).

---

### mcp — `services/mcp` (Go)
The **OAuth-protected MCP server** that lets an LLM agent work with a tenant's deployed content, scoped to one org by the same RLS as everything else.

**Main use cases**
- Speaks **Streamable-HTTP MCP**; unauthenticated requests get a 401 + RFC 9728 pointer that starts the OAuth flow against the dashboard.
- **Read tools** (`list_sites`, `list_files`, `read_file`, `download_site`, `list_skills`, `download_skill`, `download_skill_folder`, `check_skill_updates`, `get_site_chat`) — served directly from Postgres + the object store under RLS (no API hop).
- **Write tools** (`create_site`, `set_site_access`, `deploy_site`, `upload_skill`, `share_chat`, `append_chat`) — performed by **forwarding the user's OAuth token to the api** (which accepts the MCP audience), so writes reuse the API's authz, quota, projection, and audit. `share_chat` / `append_chat` publish the session transcript as a chat log (to the org library, or attached to a site as its "How this was made" panel). Requires `API_URL`; without it the server is read-only.
- Per-request **`org_meta.mcp_enabled`** kill-switch.

**Calls**
- **dashboard JWKS** — verify the Bearer token (iss/aud).
- **Postgres** — `app` schema as `dropway_app` (RLS) for reads + the mcp_enabled check.
- **Object store** (MinIO) — read manifests + blobs (org-scoped).
- **api** — write bridge for the mutating tools (forwards the user's token).

**Called by** LLM agents (Claude/Cursor/Codex) over MCP, after a browser OAuth 2.1 flow.

> Requires `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` (its own resource URL), `DATABASE_URL`, `JWKS_URL`, `DASHBOARD_URL`. The **api also needs `MCP_PUBLIC_URL`** so it accepts the forwarded MCP-audience token on write tools.

---

### serve — `services/serve` (Go) + Caddy · `*.<content-domain>`
The **content edge** for self-host: serves published sites and enforces access at the boundary. Caddy fronts it for TLS (on-demand certs) and caching; `serve` is read-only against its backends.

**Main use cases**
- Resolve `Host` → route (`resolve_host`) and stream published content from the object store.
- Enforce **access modes**: `public`, `password`, `allowlist`, `org_only`.
- For gated content with no/invalid edge cookie → **302 to the dashboard `/authz`**; on callback, verify the host-scoped `__Host-edge` token (against the API's edge JWKS, with revocation) and set the cookie.
- Serve **`llms.txt`** so LLM crawlers can discover public content.
- Inject the **"How this was made" chat panel** when the resolved route carries a `chat_id` (route projection v4): a pill plus a transcript page read from the compiled chat JSON in the object store, served under the site's own access mode (a gated site's chat stays gated).

**Calls**
- **Postgres** — `resolve_host` lookups (returns the route value, incl. `chat_id`).
- **Object store** (MinIO) — read blobs + manifests + chat transcripts.
- **Edge store** (Redis/Valkey) — read revocation.
- **api edge JWKS** (`/.well-known/edge-jwks`) — verify edge tokens.

**Called by** end users (content GET, via Caddy) and LLM crawlers (public `llms.txt`). Holds no secrets.

---

### cli — `cli` (`dropway`)
The terminal client for deploys.

**Main use cases**
- `dropway login` — browser **OAuth 2.1** (PKCE + DCR) against the dashboard; a loopback `http://localhost:<port>/callback` catches the code; tokens stored + auto-refreshed.
- `dropway deploy <dir>` — folder → live URL via the API deploy pipeline (`--send` to upload; `--new --site <slug>` to create). Dry-run without `--send`.
- `dropway sites` — list your sites (`--all` for the whole org); `dropway sites delete <id-or-slug>` removes one (`--yes` to skip the prompt in CI).
- `dropway logout`.

**Calls** the **dashboard** (OAuth discovery/register/authorize/token) and the **api** (create site, prepare, upload presigned, finalize, publish, delete). `DROPWAY_API_KEY` (an org API key) overrides login for CI.

---

## Data plane

### Postgres
- **`identity`** schema — Better Auth owns + migrates it (dashboard, privileged conn / `BETTER_AUTH_DATABASE_URL`).
- **`app`** schema — the api owns + migrates it (goose, run as the owner role); read/written as **`dropway_app`** (non-BYPASSRLS) under per-request RLS by both **api** and **mcp**.

### Object store — MinIO (`S3_*`)
Content-addressed **blobs** (`blobs/<org>/<sha256>`) + per-deploy **manifests** (`manifests/<org>/<site>/<version>.json`), plus **skill files** and compiled **chat transcripts** (the "How this was made" panel). Written by the **api** (and the **mcp** deploy/share bridges via the api); read by **api**, **mcp**, and **serve**. Note the internal vs browser-facing endpoint split (`S3_ENDPOINT` vs `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`) so presigned URLs resolve from both inside the compose network and the browser.

### Route / revocation store — Redis/Valkey
`route:<host>` projection, the revocation denylist (`revoked:*`), and per-org status (`org_status:<org>`). **api** writes; **serve** reads.

---

## Cross-cutting: tokens & trust
- The dashboard is the **only OAuth/JWT issuer** (EdDSA JWTs + JWKS). The **api** and **mcp** are verifiers; **serve** verifies a separate **edge token** signed by the api (`EDGE_SIGNING_KEY`) — the public content path carries no JWT.
- `JWT_ISSUER` / `JWT_AUDIENCE` must agree across dashboard + api; `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` must be byte-identical across dashboard, mcp, **and** api (the MCP write-bridge audience).
- Tenant isolation is enforced by **Postgres RLS** keyed on the token's `org_id`, not by application code — the api/mcp set the tenant context per request.

---

## Cross-cutting: error tracking
Every component reports caught + uncaught errors to a single error sink through a **vendor-neutral seam**, so the same failure surfaces the same way whether you run PostHog, another vendor, or nothing.

- **Go services (api, serve, mcp)** — `internal/errtrack` is the seam (the error analogue of `quota.Provider` / `projection.Writer`): a `Reporter` interface with a `Noop` default and a runtime-selected provider. Coverage is three mechanisms: a **slog bridge** (`WrapSlogHandler`) that mirrors every `slog.Error` to the sink (so `httpx.WriteError`'s 500 logging and all handler errors are captured with no call-site changes), an HTTP **`Recoverer`** that captures panics and returns a clean 500, and **`SafeGo`** for background goroutines. The shipped provider is PostHog (`internal/errtrack/posthog.go`, the official `posthog-go` SDK). Self-hosters can `Register` a Datadog/Sentry/OTLP `Reporter` under their own `ERROR_TRACKING_PROVIDER` name with no call-site changes.
- **dashboard** — three capture paths, each through a seam rather than a direct SDK call. Server errors flow through Next's `instrumentation.ts` `onRequestError` hook into `captureServerException` (the server seam in `lib/analytics-server.ts`), which uses `captureExceptionImmediate` so an event is never lost to a Vercel function freeze. Errors React hands to a boundary (`app/error.tsx`, `app/(app)/error.tsx`, `app/global-error.tsx`) go through `captureClientException` (the client seam in `lib/analytics-client.ts`). Unhandled errors + promise rejections that escape to the window are autocaptured by the browser SDK (`capture_exceptions`), configured with the SDK in `components/analytics/posthog-provider.tsx`.
- **serve worker (`edge/serving-worker`)** — the `fetch` entry wraps `serve()` and reports any unexpected throw via `captureException` in `src/errtrack.ts` (a `$exception` POST, best-effort off the response path).
- **Config** — `POSTHOG_KEY` (the same key the edge worker + dashboard use), `POSTHOG_HOST`, `ENVIRONMENT`, and optional `ERROR_TRACKING_PROVIDER`. Unset key ⇒ no reporting (the OSS/self-host default). The CLI is intentionally excluded (it runs on end-user machines).

### Switching providers
The seam is there so you can point Dropway at Datadog, Sentry, an OTLP collector, or your own service without hunting down scattered SDK calls. How you swap depends on the tier:

- **Go services** — runtime-pluggable, no fork. Implement the `errtrack.Reporter` interface for your sink, call `errtrack.Register("mysink", constructor)` from each service's `main` before `FromEnv`, and set `ERROR_TRACKING_PROVIDER=mysink`. No call-site or build changes; leave it unset (or `=none`) to disable.
- **dashboard** — edit two functions: `captureServerException` in `lib/analytics-server.ts` (server + `onRequestError`) and `captureClientException` in `lib/analytics-client.ts` (the React boundaries). Every server/boundary capture funnels through these, so they are the only call sites that touch the SDK. To also redirect the browser autocapture, swap the SDK init in `components/analytics/posthog-provider.tsx`.
- **serve worker** — edit the single `captureException` function in `src/errtrack.ts`; the `fetch` entry and route-rejection paths all route through it.

_See `deploy/docker-compose.yml` and `deploy/README.md` for the self-host wiring, and `docs/diagrams/` for the schema diagrams (`schema-app`, `schema-identity`, `schema-billing`)._
